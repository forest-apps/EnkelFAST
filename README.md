# Introduction

OpenFAST is a modular, extensible, and open-source software platform created for simulating and analyzing wind turbine systems, including both offshore and onshore configurations. It is developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

However, OpenFAST lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), which leads to a steep learning curve, manual input file handling, and limited visualization features. This makes it difficult for beginners and prone to errors in complex workflows. To overcome these challenges, users often need to rely on third-party tools or custom scripts, which increases the required effort and technical expertise.

EnkelFAST is a personal project designed to provide a GUI for OpenFAST. The name "Enkel," which means "easy" in Norwegian, reflects my fond memories of living in Norway.
